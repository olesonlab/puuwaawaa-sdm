# Paddock 9 structural sensitivity and budget sweep

Code and output for the Paddock 9 structural sensitivity (Methods and final Results section) and Tables S11 and S12 of Appendix S1 in:

> Oleson, K. L. L., Trauernicht, C., Lonsdorf, E., Parsons, E. W., and Adkins, E. Structured Decision Making reveals asymmetric tradeoffs between conservation and community objectives at Puʻuwaʻawaʻa Forest Reserve, Hawaiʻi. *Conservation Science and Practice* (in review).

The main analysis fixes full restoration of Paddock 9 (Alternative 7) as a standing commitment and optimizes the other 21 paddocks. These scripts ask what changes if Paddock 9 competes like any other paddock, and how that answer depends on the way conservation value is specified. The free-Paddock-9 runs are counterfactuals for understanding the model. They are not advice to stop conservation management in Paddock 9, which continues.

## Scripts

Run from the repository root after `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

| Script | What it does | Solver | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| `p9_budget_audit.py` | All 22 paddocks; Paddock 9 fixed or free; α = 0, 0.5, 1; seven weighting scenarios; budgets $0.5–60M; roadside fuelbreak built or not | SciPy `milp` (HiGHS) | `p9_budget_portfolios.csv`, `p9_budget_headline_comparisons.csv` |
| `p9_budget_incremental.py` | Adds `te_incremental_index`, `habitat_incremental_index` and `p9_incremental_te_index`, measured against the no-new-action reference, and rebuilds the comparisons | none | overwrites both CSVs |
| `p9_offbudget_check.py` | Published 21-paddock model with the Paddock 9 cost counted inside or outside the budget | CBC via PuLP 2.9.0 | `p9_offbudget_check.txt` (stdout) |
| `p9_ratio_budget_sweep.py` | Rancher-points-per-T&E-point exchange ratios for Rancher-conservation (S6) and Community priority (S5) at totals of $5–60M that include the Paddock 9 commitment (Table S12) | CBC via PuLP 2.9.0 | `p9_ratio_budget_sweep.txt` (stdout) |

```bash
python src/paddock9/p9_budget_audit.py
python src/paddock9/p9_budget_incremental.py
python src/paddock9/p9_offbudget_check.py   > src/paddock9/p9_offbudget_check.txt
python src/paddock9/p9_ratio_budget_sweep.py > src/paddock9/p9_ratio_budget_sweep.txt
```

The first two scripts take about 12 s together. All four take the model from `src/pww_sdm_optimizer.py` through `p9_model.py`, which adds only a total-cost figure that includes the Paddock 9 commitment and the roadside fuelbreak, and the $20M exchange-ratio summary. `p9_budget_audit.py` uses the optimizer's inputs, scoring and scenarios but builds its own 22-paddock problem, because Paddock 9 has to be able to compete.

## Conservation value specifications

- α = 0: within-paddock action ranges, as in the main analysis. Each paddock's best and worst actions span the same score range regardless of how many T&E individuals or how much native cover it holds.
- α = 0.5 and α = 1: the within-paddock range multiplied by the paddock's T&E count or native cover, normalized to the maximum and raised to the power α. Scores are rescaled so their aggregate attainable swing matches α = 0.

Community scores use global linear scaling throughout. These are alternative specifications of conservation value, not a correct and an incorrect calculation.

## Indices

`te_index` is the sum over paddocks of the recorded T&E count times the unnormalized action effectiveness of the chosen action (direct benefit plus 6 × fire reduction / maximum reduction). Alternative 11 everywhere with no roadside fuelbreak scores 1,013, the reserve's T&E count; the incremental columns subtract that reference, and `p9_incremental_te_index` subtracts Paddock 9's 580. Global linear scaling is an affine transform of this index, so it maximizes it exactly, and α = 1 maximizes a close variant. Use the index to compare fixed and free Paddock 9 within one α, not to rank the specifications.

## Provenance and reproduction check

`p9_budget_audit.py` was first written with OpenAI ChatGPT. `p9_budget_incremental.py` replaces a post-processing step from that session that was not preserved. `p9_offbudget_check.py` and `p9_ratio_budget_sweep.py` were written with Perplexity Computer. The authors specified and checked all four. The scripts were first drafted against a model copy in the companion puuwaawaa-normalization repository. On 2026-11-07 they were moved here with Anthropic Claude and pointed at `src/pww_sdm_optimizer.py`. The two models give the same inputs, scenarios and scores for within-paddock conservation and global community scaling.

Before the move, on 2026-11-07, the scripts were rerun (Linux, Python 3.14, SciPy 1.18.1, NumPy 2.5, pandas 3.1, PuLP 2.9.0):

- Solver status matched in all 336 rows of `p9_budget_portfolios.csv` (273 optimal, 63 infeasible; every infeasible row is fixed Paddock 9 at $0.5–2M), and the MIP gap was 0 in every solved row.
- Paddock assignments matched in 272 of 273 solved rows. The exception (α = 1, Paddock 9 free, Hunter-recreationist, $10M) is a tie with the same objective, indices, community scores and Paddock 9 choice; cost differs by $6,557.
- Indices and community scores matched to 2 × 10⁻¹², and all 117 comparisons matched.
- `p9_ratio_budget_sweep.txt` reproduced exactly. At $20M the on-budget run in `p9_offbudget_check.txt` reproduces the published asymmetry ratio 1.75 and exchange ratios 3.31 (S6) and 0.59 (S5).

After the move the scripts were rerun (Linux, Python 3.13, SciPy 1.18.1, NumPy 2.5.3, pandas 3.0.5, PuLP 2.9.0). Every committed output reproduced with the same results as the check above, including the one tie. `p9_offbudget_check.txt` was regenerated; only its number formatting changed.
